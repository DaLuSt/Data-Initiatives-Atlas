# Unresolved

Open questions the Atlas cannot currently answer with confidence: a fact
that couldn't be verified, a relationship that seems plausible but isn't
directly sourced, a status that couldn't be confirmed. Never guess to close
one of these — resolve it with a real source, or leave it open.

## Cross-cutting

| Entity / topic | Question | Why it's unresolved | Noted by / date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| All substantive Batch 1 entities (15 of 16) | Every factual claim | The environment's network egress policy blocks all direct page retrieval (`EGRESS_BLOCKED` for forumstandaardisatie.nl, digitaleoverheid.nl, noraonline.nl, vng.nl, logius.nl, eur-lex.europa.eu, wikipedia.org and every other host tested). Batch 1 was completed from search-engine results on explicit instruction, with the trade-off accepted knowingly. Every entity carries `verification: search-only`. | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | **Open — needs full re-verification pass** |

To find every affected entity: `grep -rl "verification: search-only" .`

## Status and temporal questions

| Entity | Question | Why it matters | Noted by / date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [[NL-FDS]] | Did the OBDO formally establish the *Afsprakenstelsel Federatief Datastelsel* in February 2026? | A search result asserted this. If true, `status` should move from `planned` to `active`/`implemented`. Recent, specific, high-consequence governance claim — must be read from a primary source. | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | Open |
| [[NL-IBDS]] | Exact date presented to the Tweede Kamer (reported as November 2021), and current status | A *Beleidsevaluatie Interbestuurlijke Datastrategie* exists on open.overheid.nl, indicating formal evaluation. Its findings may determine whether `status: active` is still correct. | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | Open |
| [[NL-DIGIBETER]] | Has NL DIGIbeter been superseded? By what, and when? | Latest actualisation found is 2020; later policy appears under "Kabinetsbeleid Digitalisering". If superseded, a successor entity plus `supersedes`/`successor` links are needed for temporal integrity. Status must not be inferred from a site's absence. | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | Open |
| [[NL-DATA-AGENDA-OVERHEID]] | Publication date, validity period, and relationship to [[NL-IBDS]] | The two cover overlapping ground. No relationship is asserted between them because none has been sourced; guessing would violate the provenance rules. | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | Open |
| [[NL-MIDO]] | Which bewindspersoon is currently responsible for MIDO and the GDI? | A search result named a specific serving State Secretary. Office-holder facts go stale silently. The Atlas currently records only the institution, deliberately. Decide whether office-holders should be modelled at all. | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | Open (design question) |

## Factual details flagged in entity bodies

| Entity | Question | Noted by / date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [[NL-PAS-TOE-OF-LEG-UIT]] | Is the procurement threshold €50,000, and is that figure current? | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | Open |
| [[NL-FORUM-STANDAARDISATIE]] | Exact 2006 establishment date and instrument reference; current status of the College Standaardisatie (established alongside the Forum) | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | Open |
| [[NL-OBDO]] | Precise boundary between the OBDO's advisory role and its decision-making role. Two Staatscourant items (stcrt-2018-9728, stcrt-2022-18861) are likely instellingsbesluiten. | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | Open |
| [[NL-GDI]] | Does "GDI" expand to *Generieke* or *Gezamenlijke* Digitale Infrastructuur? Search results used both. May be a real terminology change or inconsistent secondary sources. | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | Open |

## Entity typing questions

| Entity | Question | Noted by / date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [[NL-FDS]] | Typed `framework` on the basis of its self-description as an *afsprakenstelsel*. `initiative` or `programme` are defensible alternatives. | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | Open |
| [[NL-COMMON-GROUND]] | Typed `initiative`; described in sources as both a vision and a programme, so `framework`/`programme` are defensible. | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | Open |
| [[NL-GDI]] | Typed `platform`; it is a collection of systems and agreements rather than one system, so `framework` is partly apt too. | Batch 1 / 2026-08-14 | Open |
